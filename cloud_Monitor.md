**Avaibable monitors:**
- **Time trigger**: Vehicle leaving a defined area.

Once you have created a monitor, our **event engine** will continously check for your patern.

When our server are receiving data from your car our **event engine** will check if itâ€™s needed to send notification or not. If  our event engine reconize a pattern it will send a callback to your endpoint located in your system.

If your service is unavailable you can ask us to retry a specific number of time with a specific frequency. All theses parameters are configurable.
