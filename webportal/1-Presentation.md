# About WebPortal

![Image of Main Screen]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/WebPortal_pic.png)

The WebPortal is the browser allowing users to launch authorized Web Applications directly from the media system of their car.
All the applications function on a subscription basis and their presence on the welcome page is automatically managed by the WebPortal.

The WebPortal relies on [REST API](https://restfulapi.net/) and [MQTT protocol](http://mosquitto.org/man/mqtt-7.html).
