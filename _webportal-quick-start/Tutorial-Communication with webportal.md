# Listening to WebPortal messages

The WebPortal will forward events to your application in order to be informed about the current state of both the App and the Portal.

### Structure of a WebPortal message
```javascript
{
	/**
		* @type {string}
		*/
	"type": "WebPortal.onCurrentNotificationReceived",

	/**
		* Only present when type=WebPortal.onCurrentNotificationReceived
		* Contains the payload of the MQTT message
		*/
	"value": {}
}
```

### Handling the event messages

To deal with these events you will need to implement *event listeners* and call the functions you need in each case.
Below is an example on how to manage them.

```javascript
//Global messages listeners
window.addEventListener("message", function(event){

	var data = event.data;
	var type = event.data.type;

	switch(type){

	//When the application is killed or reloaded via an update
	case "WebPortal.onApplicationUnloaded":
	console.log("The application will be killed, it's time to save your application data");
	alert("The application will be killed, it's time to save your application data");
	break;

	//When a notification is pushed to the application
	case "WebPortal.onCurrentNotificationReceived":
	if (typeof data.value !== 'undefined'){
		console.log("Notification received",data.value);
		if (typeof data.value === 'object'){
		alert("Notification received : "+JSON.stringify(data.value));
		} else {
		alert("Notification received : "+data.value);
		}
	}
	break;
	}
});
```

We will now see how to handle the main events.
